# Transformation-of-Mathematical-Columns-
ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Pipeline

Project Overview

This repository contains a complete, professional-grade data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline designed for large datasets.
It demonstrates how to handle 3,00,000+ rows and 38 columns efficiently, covering crucial steps in data preparation for Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Outlier Detection & Handling

Detects anomalies using statistical and IQR-based methods.

Removes or caps extreme values to improve model stability.


Missing Values Imputation

Handles both numerical and categorical columns.

Supports mean, median, mode, and custom strategies.


Data Transformation

Applies Log, Square Root, and Square transformations to stabilize variance and normalize distributions.


Encoding Techniques

One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.

Ordinal Encoding for ordered categories.


Scalable for Large Data

Designed for datasets with hundreds of thousands of records without crashing.

ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning Workflow

1. Load Dataset
Import large datasets efficiently with pandas.


2. Outlier Detection

IQR-based method

Z-score thresholding



3. Handle Missing Values

Numerical: mean/median imputation

Categorical: mode or constant value



4. Apply Transformations

Log transform for skewed data

Square/Square Root for variance stabilization



5. Encoding

One-Hot Encoding for nominal categories

Ordinal Encoding for ranked data
